What is Kafka?->Distributed streaming platform for publish-subscribe messaging and real-time data pipelines.
What are the main components of Kafka?->Producer, Consumer, Broker, Topic, Partition, Zookeeper
Explain the difference between a topic and a partition.->Topic: Logical stream of data | Partition: Physical subset of a topic; allows parallelism and ordering per partition
What is a Kafka Broker?-> A server in the Kafka cluster that stores messages and serves producers/consumers.
What is the role of ZooKeeper in Kafka?->Manages cluster metadata, leader election (pre-KRaft).Newer Kafka versions can run in KRaft mode without ZooKeeper.
What is the difference between Kafka Producer and Consumer?->Producer: Sends messages to Kafka topics  | Consumer: Reads messages from Kafka topics
What is a Consumer Group?->A group of consumers sharing a group ID.|Kafka ensures each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group.
What is the difference between at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once semantics? ->At-most-once: Message may be lost (no retry) | At-least-once: Messages may be duplicated | Exactly-once: Each message processed only once.
What is offset in Kafka?-> Unique ID for a message in a partition. Used to track consumer position.
How do you commit offsets in Kafka?-> Automatically: enable.auto.commit=true | Manually: consumer.commitSync() / consumer.commitAsync()
Explain Kafka partitioning strategy.-> Default: Round-robin or based on message key hash | Ensures ordering per partition and load balancing
What is Kafka replication?-> Copies of partitions across multiple brokers for fault tolerance
What is leader and follower in Kafka partition?-> Leader: Handles all reads/writes for the partition | Follower: Replicates leader; takes over if leader fails
How does Kafka achieve high throughput?->Sequential disk I/O | Batching  |  Zero-copy transfer using sendfile  | Partitioning for parallelism
What happens when a broker goes down?-> Partition leader fails → a follower is elected as the new leader | Consumers continue reading from the new leader
Kafka vs RabbitMQ / ActiveMQ -> Kafka: Event streaming, high throughput, replayable logs |  RabbitMQ: Message queue, lower latency, point-to-point delivery
How to monitor Kafka?->Metrics: Broker, topic, consumer lag | Tools: Kafka Manager, Confluent Control Center, Prometheus, Grafana
What is log compaction?->Retains only the latest value for each key in a topic | Useful for changelogs / stateful applications
What is Kafka Connect?--> Framework to integrate Kafka with external systems (DBs, files, etc.) with minimal code
What is Kafka Streams?->Library for building real-time stream processing applications on top of Kafka
Explain ISR (In-Sync Replicas).-> Set of replicas fully caught up with the leader | Only ISRs can be elected as leader
What is KRaft mode?-->New mode in Kafka 3.x+ to remove dependency on ZooKeeper | Broker handles metadata and leader election itself
How do you achieve exactly-once semantics in Kafka Streams?->Enable idempotent producer | Use transactions for writes | Consumers commit offsets within transactions
How would you design a pipeline to process 1TB/day of log data using Kafka?-> Partition topics heavily for parallelism, use batched producers, scale brokers horizontally with replication, and process data via distributed consumers or stream processing frameworks like Spark/Kafka Streams.
How do you handle reprocessing of old messages without duplicating results?-->Reset consumer offsets to the desired timestamp/offset and ensure idempotent or transactional processing to avoid duplicate writes.
How would you scale Kafka consumers for high throughput?->Increase the number of partitions and scale consumers within the same consumer group so each partition is processed in parallel.
How to ensure ordering of events in a multi-partition topic?-> Use a consistent message key so related events go to the same partition, since Kafka guarantees ordering only within a partition.
What would you do if consumer lag keeps increasing?-> Increase partitions and scale consumers horizontally, optimize processing logic, or increase consumer fetch/batch size.
